🤖 Great! Let's start with the basics of FS2 streaming in Scala. We'll begin with creating a simple stream and then progress to more advanced topics.  
  
### Exercise 1: Basic Stream Creation  
  
**Objective**: Create a simple FS2 stream that emits the numbers from 1 to 10.  
  
**Instructions**:  
- Use the FS2 library to create a stream.  
- The stream should emit integers from 1 to 10.  
- Print each number to the console.  
  
**Test Data and Tests**:  
- Ensure the stream emits exactly the numbers from 1 to 10.  
- Verify the order of emission is correct.  
  
**Hints**:  
- You can use `Stream.emits` or `Stream.range` to create the stream.  
- Use `.compile.drain` to run the stream and see the output.  
  
Please go ahead and solve this exercise. Once you're done, submit your solution, and I'll review it and provide feedback. If you have any questions or need hints along the way, feel free to ask!

👨🏻‍🎓Solution in Scala worksheet:  
```  
import fs2.Stream  
  
val intStream = Stream.range(1, 11)  
  
intStream.map(println).compile.drain  
```

🤖 Great job! Your solution correctly creates a stream that emits integers from 1 to 10 and prints each number to the console. Here's a quick review and some feedback:  
  
### Review:  
  
1. **Stream Creation**: You used `Stream.range(1, 11)` to create a stream of integers from 1 to 10. This is correct and efficient.  
  
2. **Mapping and Printing**: You used `.map(println)` to print each number. This is a straightforward way to see the output of the stream.  
  
3. **Compilation and Running**: You used `.compile.drain` to run the stream. This is appropriate when you want to execute the stream for its side effects (in this case, printing to the console).  
  
### Feedback:  
  
- **Idiomatic Usage**: Your use of FS2 is idiomatic and follows best practices.  
- **Functional Programming**: You've maintained immutability and used pure functions, which is great for functional programming in Scala.  
  
### Next Steps:  
  
If you're ready, let's move on to the next exercise. This time, we'll work with effectful streams.
