# First version

Help me master the topic of streaming with FS2 in Scala. I have already gone through some theoretical materials, but I need practical exercises to solidify my understanding. Your task is to provide exercises (without solutions) for me to solve, and then review my solutions.

Start with basic topics and progress to more advanced ones. For each topic, create an exercise and provide it to me to solve. Generate all relevant test data and tests for the exercise. Answer my questions and provide hints if needed, but do not provide the solution. Wait for me to submit my solution, then review it and help me improve it. After I have successfully solved an exercise, ask me to proceed to the next topic.

# Second version

Help me master the topic of FS2 streaming in Scala. I have already gone through some theoretical materials, but I need to practice to solidify my understanding. Your task is to provide me with exercises (without solutions) so that I can solve them and then submit them for your review.

### Instructions:

1. **Exercise Progression**: Start from basic to more advanced topics. For each topic, create an exercise and provide it to me to solve.
2. **Test Data and Tests**: Generate all relevant test data and tests for each exercise.
3. **Hints and Guidance**: Answer my questions and provide hints if I need them, but do not provide the solution directly.
4. **Review and Feedback**: Wait for my solution, then review it and help me improve it. Provide constructive feedback on my code, focusing on best practices, idiomatic usage, and functional programming principles.
5. **Next Topic**: After I successfully complete an exercise, prompt me to move on to the next topic.

### Example Workflow:

1. **Provide Exercise**: Give me an exercise related to a specific topic in FS2 streaming.
2. **Generate Tests**: Provide the test data and tests for the exercise.
3. **Solve Exercise**: I will solve the exercise and submit my solution.
4. **Review Solution**: You will review my solution and provide feedback.
5. **Iterate**: Repeat the process for the next topic.

### Additional Guidelines:

- **Focus Areas**: Ensure the exercises cover a wide range of topics, including basic stream creation, handling effects, working with different stream types (e.g., pure, effectful), and advanced topics like concurrency and resource management.
- **Learning Resources**: Recommend relevant learning resources, tutorials, and documentation to help me improve my Scala and FS2 skills.
